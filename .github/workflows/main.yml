# This file defines a GitHub Actions workflow that is triggered when
# commits are pushed to the configured branch. It builds the Jekyll
# site in a Docker container on GitHub's infrastructure, commits the
# built code to the configured `gh_pages_branch` in this repository,
# and then requests a new GitHub Pages build.
#
# This process makes it possible to use, e.g., custom Jekyll plugins
# even if they are not whitelisted by GitHub Pages, since the plugins
# are executed as part of the continuous deployment pipeline defined
# here.
#
